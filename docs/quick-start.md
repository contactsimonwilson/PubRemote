# Pubmote Quick Start Guide

## First-Time Pubmote Setup

1. Ensure you have completed the [Hardware Prerequisites](/README.md#hardware-prerequisites) and [Software Prerequisites](/README.md#software-prerequisites) for a deployment, from the README.
    - Flash your ESP32 using the included flashing tool at [pubmote.techfoundry.nz](https://pubmote.techfoundry.nz/)
2. Configure Pubmote settings
    - On the Pubmote, navigate to the main menu by swiping down from the top of the main screen
    - Select "Settings" and swipe through the options to set your preferences
    - Select "Save" to apply your settings

3. Calibrate your Pubmote
    - On the Pubmote, navigate to the main menu by swiping down from the top of the main screen
    - Select "Calibration"
    - Select "Start" and move through the steps, selecting "Next" to continue each step, and "Save" to store your calibration.
        - For "Move stick to center", allow the joystick to sit steady.
        - For "Move stick to min/max", move the joystick smoothly to its limits of motion in all directions.
        - For "Move stick within deadband", move the joystick just slightly off-center. This will set the inner radius the Pubmote treats as no input.
        - For "Set expo factor", you may leave this at 1.00 or adjust for more or less input to tilt ratio.
        - For "Invert Y", you may check or uncheck this to flip the direction of the Y axis input.
        - View the graph for testing and save your calibration.

4. Pair the remote to your VESC Express by following the [Pairing Instructions](#pairing-instructions)
5. Ensure you've completed the [Package Side Setup](#package-side-setup-refloat)
6. Go ride!

## VESC Express to Pubmote Pairing Instructions

To ensure you can get your PubRemote paired and running, follow these simple steps after you have your Pubmote hardware assembled and have flashed the latest Pubmote software to your ESP32:

1. Install Float Accessories on your VESC Express. Available from [Syler's vesc_pkg repository](https://github.com/Relys/vesc_pkg). To install this, either:
    - Clone the repository and build the float_accessories package yourself
    - Download a relatively recent build from [pubmote.techfoundry.nz](https://pubmote.techfoundry.nz) and install using the VESC Tool custom package installer
2. Configure your VESC Express wifi and bluetooth settings
    - Navigate to VESC Express > WiFi > WiFi Mode: Set this to "Access Point"
    - Navigate to VESC Express > Bluetooth > Bluetooth Mode: Set this to "Enabled" or "Enabled with Scripting" (if needed)

3. Configure your VESC Express Float Accessories settings
    - Navigate to App UI > Settings > Pubmote Enabled
    - Ensure this is checked
    - Save and restart as necessary

4. Launch Pubmote pairing
    - On the Pubmote, navigate to the main menu by swiping down from the top of the main screen
    - Select "Pairing" and start the pairing on the Pubmote
5. Launch VESC Express Pubmote pairing
    - Navigate to App UI > Config > Pair Pubmote

6. Confirm the pairing code on both the Pubmote and VESC Express

You should now be connected!

## Package-Side Setup (Refloat)

On Refloat:
1. Navigate to Refloat Cfg > Remote
2. Ensure Remote Type is set to "UART"
3. Ensure Tiltback Angle Limit is above 0 degrees
4. Ensure Tiltback Speed is above 0 degrees/second
5. Ensure Input Deadband is below 100%, but at least 1%.
6. Set Throttle Current Maximum to 0, unless you intend to use remote throttle for fun

## Usage

While the homescreen is active, tilting the joystick will apply remote input to your VESC.

Some common scenarios where a tilt remote may be useful:
- Going up a hill, raising the nose angle
- Going down a hill, lowering the nose angle
- Accelerating quickly, raising the nose angle
- Decelerating quickly, lowering the nose angle
- Riding into headwind, lowering the nose angle to require less leaning into the wind
- Landing drops more level, lowering the nose
- Bonks or climbs over large objects, to gain clearance on the approach and exit
- Putting your friends through a Bucking Bronco mini game on your board
- Nose slides
- Tail drags
- Balance recovery
- And whatever else you might come up with!

## Common Issues and Mistakes

### The Pubmote won't connect

1. If VESC Express -> WiFi -> WiFi Mode is set to "Station Mode", it will cause connection failures with Pubmote.

The fix: It must be set to "Access Point"

2. If VESC Controller -> Refloat Cfg -> Remote ->
      - Remote Type is not set to UART
      - Tiltback Angle Limit is set to 0 째
      - Tiltback Speed is set to 0 째/s
      - Input Deadband is set to a very high %

The fix: Ensure Remote Type of  UART, Tiltback Angle Limit of >0 째, Tiltback Speed of >0 째/s, and a relatively low Input Deadband

### The direction of the tilt is backwards

The fix: Re-run calibration and check "Invert Y"

### My Float Accessories package isn't connecting to my Refloat/Float package

1. If your VESC Express and VESC Controller firmware versions are different, this will prevent communication
2. If your CAN communication between the VESC Express and VESC Controller is not functioning properly, this will prevent communication
